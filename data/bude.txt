Bude (/bjuːd/; Cornish: Porthbud) is a seaside town in north east Cornwall,
England, in the civil parish of Bude-Stratton and at the mouth of the River
Neet (also known locally as the River Strat). It was sometimes formerly known
as Bude Haven. It lies southwest of Stratton, south of Flexbury and Poughill,
and north of Widemouth Bay, located along the A3073 road off the A39. Bude is
twinned with Ergué-Gabéric in Brittany, France. Bude's coast faces Bude Bay in
the Celtic Sea, part of the Atlantic Ocean. The population of the civil parish
can be found under Bude-Stratton.  Its earlier importance was as a harbour,
and then a source of sea sand useful for improving the inland soil. This was
transported on the Bude Canal. The Victorians favoured it as a seaside
resort. With new rail links, it became a popular seaside destination in the
20th century. Bradshaw's Guide of 1866, Section 2, described Bude as: "a small
port and picturesque village in the north-eastern extremity of Cornwall". It
described the town as having the dignity of a fashionable marine resort with
excellent facilities for bathers. The harbour bed consists of fine bright
yellow sand consisting of small shells. "The sea view is of a striking, bold
and sublime description – the rocks rising on every side to lofty broken
elevations". It also describes Bude as a romantic retreat.
