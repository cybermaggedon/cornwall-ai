Exeter (/ˈɛksɪtər/ (listen)) is a cathedral city and the county town
of Devon, South West England. It is situated on the River Exe,
approximately 36 mi (58 km) northeast of Plymouth and 65 mi (105 km)
southwest of Bristol. In Roman Britain, Exeter was established as the
base of Legio II Augusta under the personal command of
Vespasian. Exeter became a religious centre in the Middle Ages. Exeter
Cathedral, founded in the mid 11th century, became Anglican in the
16th-century English Reformation. Exeter became an affluent centre for
the wool trade, although by the First World War the city was in
decline. After the Second World War, much of the city centre was
rebuilt and is now a centre for education, business and tourism in
Devon and Cornwall. It is home to two of the constituent campuses of
the University of Exeter: Streatham and St Luke's.
